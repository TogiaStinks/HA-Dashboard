## Overview

Modify your dashboard with **Kiosk Mode**! This feature transforms your Home Assistant interface into a clean, distraction-free display perfect for wall-mounted tablets or dedicated control panels. Hide the sidebar and header to create a fullscreen experience that focuses entirely on your smart home controls.

Ideal for creating a professional, streamlined look in any room while maximizing screen real estate for what matters most—your devices and automations.
